				<p>In the world’s toughest places, Engineers Without Borders USA (EWB-USA) is partnering with communities to meet their basic human needs. We’re building footbridges to provide pathways to opportunities. We’re installing solar panels to bring light where it is dark. We’re digging for water so hope can spring from the ground. Each project builds the foundation for a community to thrive for years to come. But it takes more than materials to build a strong foundation. EWB-USA’s 16,800 members are the heartbeat of our organization. These members volunteer their time, their energy and their expertise in pursuit of our vision of a world where every community has the capacity to sustainably meet their basic human needs.</p>

			<div class="mission">

				<p>Engineers Without Borders USA (EWB-USA) began with an idea: connect a developing community that has a specific infrastructure need to engineers who can partner with the community to design a sustainable solution.

				In April 2000, a representative of the Belize Ministry of Agriculture invited Dr. Bernard Amadei, Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder, to visit a community in San Pablo, Belize, to assess the community’s water supply. When Dr. Amadei visited the community, he learned that they lacked clean water and sanitation infrastructure. As a result, the local children spent a majority of their time carrying water for drinking and irrigation from miles away.

				While the community had the resources and desire to sustain a water supply system, they lacked the specific engineering skill set to design the system. Professor Amadei connected the engineering skills of his students with the community in San Pablo to create a mutually beneficial partnership.</p>

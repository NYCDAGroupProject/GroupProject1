<h1> Engineers Without Borders gives CU Boulder students engineering experience </h1>
<h2>By Shay Castle</h2>
 <p>It's winter break at the University of Colorado in Boulder, and four undergraduate students with the school's Engineers Without Borders program have just flown into Nepal to design, build and implement a water filtration system for a school in Goduk.

Five minutes into a meeting with school officials and there's a problem: the school already has water. After some investigating, the students decide instead to create filters for one of a dozen tap stands around the village.

It was on an exploratory survey of the land that the group ran into a crew working on a slow sand filter for the area, which was in need of financial and technical support. After two pivots, that became the new school project, and work began.

Two more surprises were ahead: a change in location and a different flow rate required a pre-filter that was four times larger than the first design.

"We had to recalculate everything," said Madison Baker, one of the four-person student team that included Jordan Erdie, Noah Kaiser and Anna Iisa. "We pulled an all-nighter on that one."

That pivoting provided valuable experience that is giving EWB alums an edge in the competitive hiring process that follows — and sometimes precedes — graduation.</p>

<h1>UD's Engineers Without Borders chapter develops new ideas for global communities</h1>
<h2>By Craig Stack</h2>
<p>Throughout the academic year, the University of Delaware’s chapter of Engineers Without Borders (EWB-UD) has been working on solutions to help improve the lives of people in communities around the globe.

The UD chapter, affiliated with the national organization Engineers Without Borders USA, was started in 2006 with the help of the late professor Steven Dentel, who played a large role as adviser to the group. Engineers Without Borders USA is a non-profit, humanitarian organization of dedicated and enthusiastic students and professionals who believe everyone should have access to adequate sanitation, safe drinking water and resources to meet their basic needs. 

EWB-UD works closely with the national organization to ensure that they are complying with its guidelines.

EWB-UD is made up of students from each engineering department, though most members represent chemical and biomolecular engineering, environmental engineering and civil engineering.</p>

<h1>Montana State University chapter of Engineers Without Borders will host a 5-kilometer run</h1>
<h2>By Sarah Gianelli</h2>
<p>On April 7, the Montana State University chapter of Engineers Without Borders will host a 5-kilometer run to raise funds for sanitation and clean water projects in Kenya.

The Bozeman Engineers Without Borders 5K run will take place on trails at Burke Park (Peets Hill), and will be followed by an awards ceremony at Zocalo Café in downtown Bozeman, where there will be T-shirts and other prizes, live music by a local band and Montana beer.

Proceeds from the event will help MSU’s Engineers Without Borders implement a biogas latrine and a water well at two primary schools in the Khwisero region of Kenya this summer. The latrine is designed to decrease the transfer of communicable disease into the groundwater, and the well is designed to provide clean and safe drinking water.

Approximately 20 students and five professional mentors from MSU’s Engineers Without Borders are scheduled to participate in the Kenya projects this summer.

MSU’s Engineers Without Borders has been active for 12 years, and has completed 33 projects in the Khwisero region of Kenya, including 14 water well projects, 15 sanitation projects, a water pipeline and two rainwater catchment systems. According to the organization, an estimated 100,000 people have benefited from the projects.
